BRFSS VALIDATION DEMO - ERROR EXPLANATIONS
================================================================================

This document explains each test file that was designed to fail validation,
showing exactly what's wrong and what the correct values should be.


================================================================================
1. TEXAS (TX_submission_2023.csv) - INVALID STATE FIPS CODES
================================================================================

WHAT'S WRONG:
The _STATE column contains FIPS codes that don't exist.

ERRORS IN FILE:
  Row 2:  _STATE = 99  ← Invalid (no state has FIPS 99)
  Row 4:  _STATE = 99  ← Invalid
  Row 5:  _STATE = 75  ← Invalid (no state has FIPS 75)
  Row 7:  _STATE = 99  ← Invalid
  Row 9:  _STATE = 75  ← Invalid

WHAT IT SHOULD BE:
  Texas FIPS code = 48

  Row 2:  _STATE = 48  ← Correct
  Row 4:  _STATE = 48  ← Correct
  Row 5:  _STATE = 48  ← Correct
  Row 7:  _STATE = 48  ← Correct
  Row 9:  _STATE = 48  ← Correct

WHY THIS MATTERS:
FIPS codes are standardized federal codes for states. Using invalid codes
means the data can't be properly attributed to any real state, making it
useless for geographic analysis.

VALIDATION RESULT: Passed with Errors (50% error rate)


================================================================================
2. NEW YORK (NY_submission_2023.csv) - DAYS VALUES OUT OF RANGE
================================================================================

WHAT'S WRONG:
The PHYSHLTH (Physical Health Days) and MENTHLTH (Mental Health Days) columns
contain values greater than 30. These fields ask "how many days in the past 30
days" so values cannot exceed 30.

ERRORS IN FILE:
  Row 2:  PHYSHLTH = 45  ← Invalid (max is 30)
  Row 3:  PHYSHLTH = 50  ← Invalid
  Row 4:  PHYSHLTH = 60  ← Invalid
  Row 5:  PHYSHLTH = 35  ← Invalid
  Row 6:  PHYSHLTH = 42  ← Invalid
  Row 7:  MENTHLTH = 55  ← Invalid
  Row 8:  MENTHLTH = 40  ← Invalid
  Row 10: PHYSHLTH = 38, MENTHLTH = 45  ← Both invalid

WHAT IT SHOULD BE:
  Valid range: 0-30, or special codes 77 (Don't Know), 88 (None), 99 (Refused)

  Row 2:  PHYSHLTH = 30  ← Maximum valid value
  Row 3:  PHYSHLTH = 30  ← Maximum valid value
  Row 7:  MENTHLTH = 30  ← Maximum valid value

WHY THIS MATTERS:
The question asks about the past 30 days, so mathematically a person cannot
have more than 30 days of poor health in a 30-day period. Values like 45 or
60 are impossible and indicate data entry errors.

VALIDATION RESULT: Failed (>50% error rate)


================================================================================
3. OHIO (OH_submission_2023.csv) - INVALID ALCOHOL CONSUMPTION CODES
================================================================================

WHAT'S WRONG:
The ALCDAY4 (Alcohol Days per Month) column uses an invalid coding scheme.

BRFSS uses a special format for alcohol consumption:
  - 101-199 = Days per WEEK (e.g., 103 = 3 days per week)
  - 201-299 = Days per MONTH (e.g., 215 = 15 days per month)
  - 777 = Don't know
  - 888 = No drinks in past 30 days
  - 999 = Refused

ERRORS IN FILE:
  Row 2:  ALCDAY4 = 350  ← Invalid (not in any valid range)
  Row 3:  ALCDAY4 = 450  ← Invalid
  Row 4:  ALCDAY4 = 500  ← Invalid
  Row 6:  ALCDAY4 = 600  ← Invalid
  Row 8:  ALCDAY4 = 750  ← Invalid
  Row 10: ALCDAY4 = 400  ← Invalid

WHAT IT SHOULD BE:
  Row 2:  ALCDAY4 = 103  ← 3 days per week
  Row 3:  ALCDAY4 = 215  ← 15 days per month
  Row 4:  ALCDAY4 = 888  ← No drinks
  Row 6:  ALCDAY4 = 202  ← 2 days per month

WHY THIS MATTERS:
The special coding scheme allows distinguishing between frequent drinkers
(measured in days per week) and occasional drinkers (measured in days per
month). Codes like 350 or 500 don't fit either category and can't be
interpreted.

VALIDATION RESULT: Failed (>50% error rate)


================================================================================
4. MICHIGAN (MI_submission_2023.csv) - TEXT IN NUMERIC FIELDS
================================================================================

WHAT'S WRONG:
Several numeric fields contain text values instead of numbers. This is a
common data entry error when someone types descriptions instead of codes.

ERRORS IN FILE:
  Row 2:  GENHLTH = "good"       ← Should be numeric code
  Row 3:  PHYSHLTH = "ten"       ← Should be numeric
  Row 4:  MENTHLTH = "five"      ← Should be numeric
  Row 5:  GENHLTH = "fair"       ← Should be numeric code
  Row 6:  PHYSHLTH = "N/A"       ← Should be numeric or blank
  Row 8:  GENHLTH = "excellent"  ← Should be numeric code
  Row 9:  PHYSHLTH = "#REF!"     ← Excel error carried over
  Row 10: MENTHLTH = "abc"       ← Random text
  Row 11: GENHLTH = "poor"       ← Should be numeric code

WHAT IT SHOULD BE:
  GENHLTH uses codes 1-5:
    1 = Excellent
    2 = Very Good
    3 = Good
    4 = Fair
    5 = Poor

  Row 2:  GENHLTH = 3   ← Code for "Good"
  Row 5:  GENHLTH = 4   ← Code for "Fair"
  Row 8:  GENHLTH = 1   ← Code for "Excellent"
  Row 11: GENHLTH = 5   ← Code for "Poor"

  PHYSHLTH and MENTHLTH use actual day counts (0-30):
  Row 3:  PHYSHLTH = 10  ← Numeric value
  Row 4:  MENTHLTH = 5   ← Numeric value

WHY THIS MATTERS:
Numeric codes allow for statistical analysis and comparison across datasets.
Text values like "good" or "N/A" can't be aggregated or analyzed without
manual conversion, and errors like "#REF!" indicate corrupted source data.

VALIDATION RESULT: Failed (>50% error rate)


================================================================================
5. ARIZONA (AZ_submission_2023.csv) - INVALID GENERAL HEALTH CODES
================================================================================

WHAT'S WRONG:
The GENHLTH (General Health) column contains codes outside the valid range.

Valid GENHLTH codes:
  1 = Excellent
  2 = Very Good
  3 = Good
  4 = Fair
  5 = Poor
  7 = Don't know / Not sure
  9 = Refused

ERRORS IN FILE:
  Row 2:  GENHLTH = 6   ← Invalid (no code 6 exists)
  Row 3:  GENHLTH = 8   ← Invalid (no code 8 exists)
  Row 4:  GENHLTH = 0   ← Invalid (codes start at 1)
  Row 5:  GENHLTH = 10  ← Invalid (max valid is 9)
  Row 6:  GENHLTH = 6   ← Invalid
  Row 8:  GENHLTH = 8   ← Invalid
  Row 10: GENHLTH = 0   ← Invalid
  Row 11: GENHLTH = 10  ← Invalid

WHAT IT SHOULD BE:
  Row 2:  GENHLTH = 5  ← "Poor" if that was intended
  Row 3:  GENHLTH = 7  ← "Don't know" if uncertain
  Row 4:  GENHLTH = 1  ← "Excellent" (not 0)
  Row 5:  GENHLTH = 5  ← "Poor" (closest to 10?)

WHY THIS MATTERS:
Using undefined codes makes responses uninterpretable. Code 6 doesn't map
to any health status, so we don't know what the respondent meant. This
corrupts the data quality.

VALIDATION RESULT: Failed (>50% error rate)


================================================================================
6. NEVADA (NV_submission_2023.csv) - INVALID DIABETES CODES
================================================================================

WHAT'S WRONG:
The DIABETE4 (Diabetes Status) column contains codes outside the valid range.

Valid DIABETE4 codes:
  1 = Yes
  2 = Yes, but only during pregnancy (females)
  3 = No
  4 = No, pre-diabetes or borderline diabetes
  7 = Don't know / Not sure
  9 = Refused

ERRORS IN FILE:
  Row 2:  DIABETE4 = 5   ← Invalid (no code 5)
  Row 3:  DIABETE4 = 6   ← Invalid (no code 6)
  Row 4:  DIABETE4 = 8   ← Invalid (no code 8)
  Row 5:  DIABETE4 = 5   ← Invalid
  Row 6:  DIABETE4 = 10  ← Invalid (max valid is 9)
  Row 8:  DIABETE4 = 6   ← Invalid
  Row 10: DIABETE4 = 5   ← Invalid
  Row 11: DIABETE4 = 8   ← Invalid

WHAT IT SHOULD BE:
  Row 2:  DIABETE4 = 3  ← "No" if not diabetic
  Row 3:  DIABETE4 = 4  ← "Pre-diabetes" perhaps intended
  Row 4:  DIABETE4 = 7  ← "Don't know" perhaps intended
  Row 6:  DIABETE4 = 9  ← "Refused" perhaps intended

WHY THIS MATTERS:
Diabetes status is critical health data. Invalid codes mean we can't
determine if someone is diabetic, pre-diabetic, or healthy. This affects
prevalence calculations and public health planning.

VALIDATION RESULT: Failed (>50% error rate)


================================================================================
7. ILLINOIS (IL_submission_2023.csv) - INVALID SEATBELT CODES
================================================================================

WHAT'S WRONG:
The SEATBELT (Seatbelt Use) column contains codes outside the valid range.

Valid SEATBELT codes:
  1 = Always
  2 = Nearly always
  3 = Sometimes
  4 = Seldom
  5 = Never
  7 = Don't know / Not sure
  8 = Never drive or ride in a car
  9 = Refused

ERRORS IN FILE:
  Row 2:  SEATBELT = 10  ← Invalid (max valid is 9)
  Row 3:  SEATBELT = 15  ← Invalid
  Row 4:  SEATBELT = 0   ← Invalid (codes start at 1)
  Row 5:  SEATBELT = 6   ← Invalid (no code 6 exists)
  Row 6:  SEATBELT = 20  ← Invalid
  Row 8:  SEATBELT = 12  ← Invalid
  Row 10: SEATBELT = 25  ← Invalid

WHAT IT SHOULD BE:
  Row 2:  SEATBELT = 1  ← "Always" perhaps intended
  Row 3:  SEATBELT = 1  ← "Always"
  Row 4:  SEATBELT = 5  ← "Never" (not 0)
  Row 5:  SEATBELT = 5  ← "Never" perhaps (closest to 6)

WHY THIS MATTERS:
Seatbelt usage is a key safety indicator tracked by public health agencies.
Invalid codes make it impossible to calculate accurate usage rates or
identify populations at risk.

VALIDATION RESULT: Failed (>50% error rate)


================================================================================
8. CALIFORNIA (CA_submission_2023.csv) - MIXED ERRORS (Pre-existing)
================================================================================

This file contains a mix of various error types that were already present:

  - GENHLTH = 8 (invalid code)
  - PHYSHLTH = 45 (exceeds 30-day maximum)
  - MENTHLTH = "abc" (text in numeric field)
  - BPHIGH6 = 6 (invalid blood pressure code)

This demonstrates how real-world data often has multiple types of errors
mixed together.

VALIDATION RESULT: Varies based on error density


================================================================================
